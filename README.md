## Load Test

Load test is performed using [k6.io](https://k6.io/) and the setup script is available at [./tests/load/script.js](./tests/load/script.js).

1. Build the container images
    ```
    make load-test-build
    ```

2. Start containers
    ```
    make load-test-up
    ```

3. Run the load test (requires [k6.io](https://k6.io/))
    ```
    make load-test
    ```
